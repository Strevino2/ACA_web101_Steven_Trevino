                <h2>For more than a third of my life, I have always had a fascination with becoming a developer and I
                    have
                    started this journey this year with Austin Coding Academy. Most people tell me that it is the future
                    when someone asks me about my job and my life but I like to think of this shift in career as a
                    life-style change more than just work-related. </h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>About me: <br> <br> Born in the hill country of Texas and raised during the 90s, I grew up playing
                    many
                    sports and video games. Good internet was very rare due to the area I lived in but small town living
                    and
                    a great community more than made up for this hindrance. The start of my web development career has
                    its
                    own story filled with fate. </p>
                <p>I started my first dive into web development in college at Angelo State University. As with some
                    teenagers
                    at that time, I couldn't make my mind up on what Bachelor degree to settle on. Before I could finish
                    college I was hired with a medical transportation company specializing in medical logistics for the
                    major hospital systems around the San Antonio and Austin area. Quickly worked my way up to Area
                    Manager
                    and excelled at this position. I was eventually laid off due to the pandemic and when our company
                    was
                    bought out by another company from the east coast. I decided then that this was a blessing in
                    disguise.
                </p>
                <p>After scouring the web for a direction after being laid off, I decided to get back on the train to
                    becoming a developer when I ran across the website for Austin Coding Academy. After a few short
                    talks
                    with an admissions adviser and taking a few free weeks of learning courses, my new journey had
                    begun!!

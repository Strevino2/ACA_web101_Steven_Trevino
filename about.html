            <p>For more than a third of my life, I have always had a fascination with becoming a developer and I
              have
              started this journey this year with Austin Coding Academy. Most people tell me that it is the future
              when someone asks me about my job and my life but I like to think of this shift in career as a
              life-style change. </p>
            <!-- <p>About me: <br> <br> Born in the hill country of Texas and raised during the 90s, I grew up playing
              many
              sports and video games. Good internet was very rare due to the area I lived in but small town living
              and
              a great community more than made up for this hindrance. The start of my web development career has
              its
              own story filled with fate. </p>
            <p>I started my first dive into web development in college at Angelo State University. As with some
              teenagers
              at that time, I couldn't make my mind up on what Bachelor degree to settle on. Before I could finish
              college I was hired with a medical transportation company specializing in medical logistics for the
              major hospital systems around the San Antonio and Austin area. Quickly worked my way up to Area
              Manager
              and excelled at this position. I was eventually laid off due to the pandemic and when our company
              was
              bought out by another company from the east coast. I decided then that this was a blessing in
              disguise.
            </p>
            <p>After scouring the web for a direction after being laid off, I decided to get back on the train to
              becoming a developer when I ran across the website for Austin Coding Academy. After a few short
              talks
              with an admissions adviser and taking a few free weeks of learning courses, my new journey had
              begun!!
